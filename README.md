# Project1_CAP4630_Shank
A tic-tac-toe AI program that allows a player to play against the computer. The best possible outcome is that there is a tie. The player can never win. 
How to install and run the program: I wrote this in VisualStudioCode. You can use whatever compiler you have that can run python. Download the file and open it there before running. Follow the instruction on your console to play the game. 
This game should be used as a fun way to test the power of Artifical Intelligence as it applies to game play. 
Credit: The minimax algorithm and associated parts were taken from javacodingcommunity (https://github.com/javacodingcommunity/TicTacToeAI-with-Minimax/blob/main/ticTacToeAI.py). Other functions were inspired by their set up to keep me on track with how I design my program as well. Specific details can be found in the .py file header.
